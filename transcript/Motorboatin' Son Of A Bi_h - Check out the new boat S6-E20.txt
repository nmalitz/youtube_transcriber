motorboat sound of a welcome to the dark side that's motor vessel The Darkside she's a 1997 Hatteras 52 that's been customized and extended 8 feet by adding a knife cockpit and swim deck she has three cabins and three heads and is capable of making 20 knots but it's much happier at 15 knots and it most economical cruise is about 10 knots it's my first foray into the motor yacht side of things so hopefully you guys like it now let's take it to her boats lined up so don't worry about that but I'm going to give you a tour right now of this boat will start you out on the bow of the boat here this is The Windlass it is a galley maid windlass it's pretty strong winless and then it's got two anchors up here the both Danforth ones of Fortress ones the other ones aluminum really not that great a pretty nice one but I'm changing both of those out 1/4 in very small that by any chance have foot pedals up front here and then I can actually also control The Windlass from the helm station up there lots of space for hanging out and just storing like in one we got all the lines and in all the cleaning products greater I did replace refrigerator was kind of failing so had to pull this glass out and pull the old refrigerator out through the window I'll show you the inside then let's go air conditioner is really hot or still want to hang out here to close all this up and turn the air conditioner on and it would be nice and cool up here so we're here so this is really I think we're the main kind of entertainment and socializing area is going to be alright this is one of the unique things about this but I don't know of any other Hatteras 52 is that it had it done course I haven't looked either you this is not standard on a 5252 and right here and a little little baby little swim platform Bissell Big Enough 13 kilowatts bid plenty big enough to power everything on the boat and if I need to have it worked on or replaced or anything it's right there so easy to pull in and out I mean so you know if I had to replace that 20 I replaced them because the old ones weren't working they were sold for the really cool thing about this boat is that you have asked controls here you can control the both Motors and The Windlass and the balance restaurant which is really cool you can stop and start the motor to if you need to and because if you're trying to talk back here meme from up there you can't see back here you can see us when you're talking it's really easy to do this and thrust right gas station sunglasses whatever I needed some sunglasses I bought some white ones in the video there were so many just like negative comments like like bad hydraulic crane with a went with winch in it that runs over picks up the win the Denny and then drops it in the water so I think it's rated to 1,500 lb looking for Tom unit in here and underneath it I added a is and so now it has a is and a new radio and it works pretty well a piece of plywood plywood the guy in Florida I believe that can replace him I just haven't had time to Tice got to pull them out and put them in they work but I only can only like reading in the dark the new version 9 in little bit bigger and in the same thing over here used to have giant an old-school like laser nav chartplotter which was massive and then an old-school radar from the 90s as well so I mean a big not LED or LCD screen the props if the engines are out of sync it just makes a weird noise and just doesn't do that and it's all so I can control The Windlass from up here as well and bilge pumps and start and stop the motors and all that stuff it does have stabilizers to so there's two little fins that stick off on either side of the boat and with the stabilizers on they trim up and down which side the boats go into Port is trims the port side up right and so it brings it back up I got a quote to all the linoleum in here done and the galleys and the bathrooms it was like $10,000 that's all new this is your main light power distribution panel under here behind here are your actual generator controls get the transfer switch here and then down below is the actual panel where you can control both generators inverter charges be able to handle that I know in air conditioners and stuff I mean maybe can get a big enough but I'd like to be able to make this an off-grid boat ride don't have to depend on running a generator all the time even an anchor let's go down into the galley with a dishwasher but again finding one like they're they do make 18 inch wide I mean finding one of those down here in Puerto Rico go to Lowe's or something we'll have it the next day here you can't really do it and I just love having I mean it'll kill all the weevils and stuff in it so that you don't have a weevil infestation or audio wherever you get your podcast iTunes or Spotify whatever it said where iHeartRadio I believe so go forward one thing I forgot to mention I just got these seagulls from Aqua star Distributors go check them out these are a water purification system stay there but they're really literally sick a couple times add mom's kind of like you know if your buddy just socializing over this would be the head to choose a shower let's continue access to the engine room is under these stairs right here so you can hook it on there so crawling into the engine room here Series Detroit Diesel turbocharged Motors that are 720 horsepower which gives you about 15 Gallons an hour or 7 on each side plus one for the generator will give you about 10 10 and 1/2 not so I think that's going to be my normal Crews on these is 1200 RPMs which is the most fuel economical way to get around on the other side of battery banks on the other side and holding tank is forward in the front as well by giving this a shot for now so thank you guys for watching please put the like And subscribe button check out the Doodles podcast if you don't mind and we're about to take this thing out in the water I got it's really cool so I got a couple days and Taylor's coming back
